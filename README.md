# ReinforcedLearningSnake

GitHub repository for the Reinforced Learning Snake game.


## Game Scripts
There are two scripts for the game:

- SnakeScriptExplicitControls.py: This script implements the snake game with explicit controls. The player can control the snake using the arrow keys.
- SnakeScriptRelativeControls.py: The snake can only turn left or right. This is useful for training the snake using reinforcement learning.
